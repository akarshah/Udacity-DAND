# Analysis of The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 study

## by Aakar Shah

## Preliminary Wrangling

> PISA is a worldwide study developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to examine the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world. The study assesses students’ maths, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students’ background, their school and the organisation of the education system. For most countries, the sample is around 5,000 students, but in some countries the number is even higher. In total, the PISA 2012 dataset contains data on 485 490 pupils.

## Summary of Findings


- **How do students from individual countries perform in Math, Reading and Science literacy?**
    - Eastern countries such as China, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong outperform other countires

- **What is the effect of teachers on student grades?**
    - We could only find a weak positive correlation between teachers and student grades. 

- **What is the effect of conducive home environment on student grades?**
    - We discovered that either parent staying at home showed increase in student grades

- **What effect does student's own perseverence and study ethics has on his/her grades?**
    - We could not find any significant impact of personal traits on grades

- **Do grades differ based on gender across subjects in higher percentiles?**
    - We discovered that as the Males perform better in Math and Science where as Females perform better in Reading.
